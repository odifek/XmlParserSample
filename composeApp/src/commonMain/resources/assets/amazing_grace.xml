    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Through many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v5">
      <lines>When we've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun.</lines>
    </verse>
